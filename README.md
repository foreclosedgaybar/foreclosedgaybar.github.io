1. What are the affordances (benefits) of these digital tools and/or computational methods? Consider, for instance, how you would use this specific approach, and towards what kind of research questions.  
2. What are some limitations to this methodology/tool? 
3. Experiment with the database – what would you do with all this data at your disposal? What would you add to the database? What would be some variants and specific examples (e.g. film genres, film traditions, national cinemas) that could generate interesting comparative analysis? 
4. Consider the “so what?” question. Or, in this case, whether this particular tool/platform generates new knowledge (in Tzivian’s words, ” new questions” for “old answers,” not “new answers given to old questions” –or, new questions beyond old answers…?).

For Class:
- "I am coming from a studio arts/new media background so my language/vernacular/understanding of formal digital humanities might not port directly at first - - - but all my labor is, to my understanding, definitely within any digital humanities field: just being engaged in a different syntax." 

About Me:
- ♈ "Tannon Reckling is a transdisciplinary queer organizer, writer, _____ , and curator. Reckling is an incoming graduate 
student studying HIV/AIDS activism through new media at Tisch School, New York University. Reckling has previously attended 
University of Oregon, University of California- Los Angeles. Reckling has curated and shown work in Philadelphia, PA, New York 
City, NY, Los Angeles, CA, Venice, Italy, and more. Reckling is co-organizing the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s ‘Day Without Day 2022’iteration. Reckling recently curated the exhibition ‘Spreading Lights’ at Vox Populi in Philadelphia, PA which explored: “the virus,” queer play, and necropolitics."
