For Class:
- "I am coming from a studio arts/new media background so my language/vernacular/understanding of formal digital humanities might not port directly at first-but all my labor is, to be understanding, definitely within a digital humanities feild: just being engaged in a different field." 

About Me:
- "Tannon Reckling is a transdisciplinary queer organizer, writer, teacher, and curator. Reckling is an incoming graduate 
student studying HIV/AIDS activism through new media at Tisch School, New York University. Reckling has previously attended 
University of Oregon, University of California- Los Angeles. Reckling has curated and shown work in Philadelphia, PA, New York 
City, NY, Los Angeles, CA, Venice, Italy, and more. Reckling is co-organizing the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s ‘Day Without Day 2022’
iteration. Reckling recently curated the exhibition ‘Spreading Lights’ at Vox Populi in Philadelphia, PA which explored: “the virus,” 
queer play, and necropolitics."
