🌐 This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) / I am trying GitHub as a way of experimenting with professional free personal website platforms...

🌈 a link to my WIP [ABOUT ME PAGE](https://github.com/foreclosedgaybar/foreclosedgaybar.github.io/blob/aa9988fcc11d1cc68c57f490387d5b4045916577/AboutMe)

Info: 'foreclosedgaybar' has been my online handle for years and I'm just keeping it for now... / My values in making include: exploring queer ontologies online and their IRL affects in visual culture.

(WIP)
For Class:
- "I am coming from a studio arts/new media background so my language/vernacular/understanding of formal digital humanities might not port directly at first - - - but all my labor is, to my understanding, definitely within any digital humanities field: just being engaged in a different syntax." 

About Me:
- "Tannon Reckling is a transdisciplinary queer organizer, writer, teacher, and curator. Reckling is an incoming graduate 
student studying HIV/AIDS activism through new media at Tisch School, New York University. Reckling has previously attended 
University of Oregon, University of California- Los Angeles. Reckling has curated and shown work in Philadelphia, PA, New York 
City, NY, Los Angeles, CA, Venice, Italy, and more. Reckling is co-organizing the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s ‘Day Without Day 2022’
iteration. Reckling recently curated the exhibition ‘Spreading Lights’ at Vox Populi in Philadelphia, PA which explored: “the virus,” 
queer play, and necropolitics."
